Introduction: ​The aim of the project is to predict the movie ratings with the help of
movie reviews using deep learning.

Data: The Project was experimented on different movie reviews collected from
different movies, there are a total of 50,000 Movie reviews​ collected from the IMDB
dataset with not more than 30 reviews from each movie.

Method:

Training:
We trained the network with 25,000 movie reviews, we used Multi layer
perceptron network with three hidden layers to train the network.

Testing:
The testing was done on the remaining 25000 movie reviews.

Results:
We have achieved an accuracy of 88.02%

Summary:
Here in this project we predict the ratings of the movie based on reviews
using the help of deep learning models, at first we train the network with 25000 reviews
which helps the network learn different parameters associated with the reviews and
ratings, then using the network we predict the ratings for a new review, we have
successfully completed the project by having an accuracy of 88.02%
